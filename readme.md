## Current Status

**This project is on hold.**

This repository aims to transform the NERC metadata i.e. `*.xml` into a [Plain old CLR Object (POCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_CLR_object) for ease of development.

It is designed and built as a C# library, so it could be used in other C# project in the further.
